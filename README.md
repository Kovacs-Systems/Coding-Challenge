# Coding-Challenge

Create an http microservice that takes an array of image urls and an optional file name, and returns a url to a zip folder containing all the images. The response time should be less than 100ms and the number of images passed in should be greater than 0 but less than 100.

Using React, create a web application to collect the list of image urls, send them to the microservice, and display the response url. How this interface is organized is up to you, but we will be evaluating based on elements of design, responsiveness, accessibility, and code cleanliness.
