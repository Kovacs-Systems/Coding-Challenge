# Coding-Challenge

Create an http microservice that takes an array of image urls and an optional file name, and returns a url to a zip foldered containing all the images. The response time should be less than 100ms and the number of images passed in should be greater than 0 but less than 100.

Create a React front end that takes a list of image urls and passes them to the microservice and displays the url for the zip folder to download.
